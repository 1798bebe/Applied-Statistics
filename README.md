This is a project report from the course 'Applied Statistics with Computer' at Sogang University.

The purpose of this report is to gather data on the South and North Korean populations residing in Germany, apply various statistical estimation and testing methods learned during class, and analyze the results.

One notable observation is that the North Korean population is much more concentrated in West Germany than in East Germany, despite East Germany's former ties to the Communist bloc. This suggests that, contrary to what might be expected, political alignment didn't lead North Koreans to settle in East Germany, but rather, they preferred West Germany for other reasons.

The complete SAS code is uploaded under the name 'the_whole_code.sas,' along with the tabular data 'onecolumndata.txt' and the output window 'result_window.pdf.'

The report is uploaded under the name '(ENG)final_report.'
